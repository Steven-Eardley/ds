# Question 1:
#		Yes, it is necessary to reply with the table. Consider a chain of nodes:

# node n1 1
# node n2 2
# node n3 3

# link n1 n2
# link n2 n3

# send n1

# 		In this situation, node n1 or n2 will not gain complete knowledge of the
#       network. Without pending reply messages the algorithm will converge
#       early with an incomplete graph. Node n3 will gain complete knowledge as
#       it is hears the update from n2, but n2 will be missing information for
#       n3, and n1 will not hear about either n3 or n2. The addition of replies
#       ensures the information exchange is always bi-directional.

# Question 2:
#		There are fewer messages sent, and therefore fewer events so in the
#		best case (a cyclic or highly connected graph) a complete and correct
#		map would be found sooner. Therefore, network topology does have an
#		effect on the requirement for reply messages. For the correctness of
#		the algorithm in all topologies however, the reply messages are
#		required. 

#		Of note is that different results are found depending on
#		which node initiates sending of tables - if n2 in the example above
#		were to send its table first, the complete graph would be found in 20
#		events, rather than 16 when starting from n1 with the standard
#		algorithm. Without replies the complete graph can never be found in
#		any case since the only channel for the information is back to the
#		sender.

#		The aforementioned issue is irrelevent when nodes periodically resend
#		their tables since, for example, n2 would hear from n3 in time even
#		if not immediately, and the graph would be completed on the next
#		iteration.
